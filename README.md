# Overview:
Create a prototype of a mobile web-based dubbing interface, leveraging AI-assisted coding to
maximize productivity. This assignment is designed to be completed in 2 hours by a developer
proficient in using AI coding assistants like Claude.
# Requirements:
Create a single-page React application with the following features:
1. Video Player
* Implement a basic video player that can play/pause a video.
* Include a progress bar for seeking.
* Use a short (30-second) sample video.
2. Audio Recording
* Implement audio recording using the Web Audio API.
* Include start, stop, and playback functionality.
* Display a waveform visualization of the recording.
3. Dialogue Display
* Show the current dialogue text below the video player.
* Include editable fields for "Original Text" and "Translated Text".
4. Mobile-First Design
* Use Tailwind CSS to create a responsive, mobile-first design.
* Ensure the interface is fully functional on both mobile and desktop views.
5. State Management
* Use React Context API for managing global state (current dialogue, recording status, etc.).
6. Navigation
* Implement buttons to move between dialogues (mock data for 3-5 dialogues is sufficient).
7. Synchronization
* Ensure the recorded audio can be played back in sync with the video.
8. Error Handling
* Implement basic error handling for audio/video playback issues.
# Bonus Features (if time allows):
* Implement a basic offline mode (e.g., saving recording progress to local storage).
* Add a simple user authentication flow.
